# Karatsuba Multiplication Modules in Verilog

## Overview

This repository contains two implementations of the Karatsuba multiplication algorithm, written in Verilog:

1. **Combinational Karatsuba Multiplier**: A purely combinational approach to implement Karatsuba multiplication for fast parallel computation.
2. **Iterative Karatsuba Multiplier**: A resource-efficient iterative implementation that uses a single multiplier for sub-calculations, optimizing hardware usage at the expense of increased latency.

### About Karatsuba Algorithm
The Karatsuba algorithm is an efficient method for multiplying large numbers, developed by Anatolii Karatsuba. It reduces the computational complexity from \(O(n^2)\) (traditional multiplication) to \(O(n^{\log_2(3)}) \approx O(n^{1.585})\), making it well-suited for hardware implementations of large multipliers.

Karatsuba achieves this by breaking the operands into smaller parts and performing recursive multiplications and additions to compute the final product. The basic steps include:
1. Splitting the numbers into higher and lower halves.
2. Computing three partial products: \( P_0 \), \( P_1 \), and \( P_2 \).
3. Combining the partial products with appropriate shifts and additions to obtain the final result.

## Combinational Karatsuba Multiplier

### Description
The combinational implementation performs the entire Karatsuba multiplication in a single clock cycle using parallelism. This design achieves high throughput at the cost of significant hardware resource usage.

### Key Features
- **Parallel Processing**: All partial products and additions are computed simultaneously.
- **High Throughput**: Results are computed in one cycle, making this suitable for applications requiring high-speed multipliers.
- **Recursive Structure**: Supports hierarchical decomposition for large bit-width multiplications.

### Technical Details
- **Inputs**:
  - `a`: Operand A (N-bit)
  - `b`: Operand B (N-bit)
- **Output**:
  - `result`: Product of `a` and `b` (2N-bit)
- **Algorithm**:
  - Split `a` and `b` into high and low halves.
  - Compute:
    - \( P_0 = \text{Low}(a) \cdot \text{Low}(b) \)
    - \( P_2 = \text{High}(a) \cdot \text{High}(b) \)
    - \( P_1 = (\text{Low}(a) + \text{High}(a)) \cdot (\text{Low}(b) + \text{High}(b)) - P_0 - P_2 \)
  - Combine the partial products:
    \( \text{result} = P_2 \cdot 2^{2M} + P_1 \cdot 2^M + P_0 \)
- **Resource Usage**:
  - Requires multiple multipliers and adders proportional to the recursion depth.

### Applications
- High-speed DSP systems.
- Cryptographic applications requiring rapid large-integer multiplications.

## Iterative Karatsuba Multiplier

### Description
The iterative implementation optimizes hardware resources by reusing a single multiplier for sub-calculations. This design is slower than the combinational approach but significantly reduces hardware usage.

### Key Features
- **Resource Efficiency**: Utilizes one multiplier, reducing hardware costs.
- **Iterative Control Logic**: Sequentially computes partial products, combining them iteratively.
- **Scalability**: Supports larger bit-widths without an exponential increase in resource consumption.

### Technical Details
- **Inputs**:
  - `a`: Operand A (N-bit)
  - `b`: Operand B (N-bit)
- **Output**:
  - `result`: Product of `a` and `b` (2N-bit)
- **Algorithm**:
  - Similar to the combinational approach but implemented iteratively:
    - Compute \( P_0 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_1 \) using a single multiplier.
    - Store intermediate results in registers.
    - Perform addition and shifting operations iteratively.
  - Final result is constructed after all iterations.
- **Hardware Architecture**:
  - Single multiplier.
  - Adders, shift registers, and control logic for iteration.
- **Timing**:
  - Latency depends on the number of iterations (recursive depth).

### Applications
- Resource-constrained embedded systems.
- Hardware accelerators where area efficiency is prioritized over speed.
